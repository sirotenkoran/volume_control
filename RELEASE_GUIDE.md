# üöÄ Release Guide

This guide explains how to create releases and manage the automated build process.

## üìã Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Write access to the repository
- Git configured locally
- Python virtual environment with dependencies installed

## üîß Setup Dependencies

Before creating releases, make sure your environment is properly set up:

```bash
# Create virtual environment (if not exists)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller
```

## üîÑ Automated Build Process

### Build Test (Every Push)
- **Trigger**: Every push to `main` or `master` branch
- **Action**: Builds the exe file and uploads as artifact
- **Purpose**: Verify that the code builds successfully
- **Location**: GitHub Actions ‚Üí Artifacts ‚Üí `AppVolumeControl-Test`

### Release Build (Tag-based)
- **Trigger**: Push a tag starting with `v` (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- **Action**: Builds the exe and creates a GitHub Release
- **Purpose**: Create official releases for users
- **Location**: GitHub ‚Üí Releases

## üè∑Ô∏è Creating a Release

### Option 1: Using PowerShell Script (Recommended for Windows)

The PowerShell script handles quotes properly and provides better error handling:

```powershell
# Create a release with version v1.2.3
.\create_release.ps1 -Version "v1.2.3"

# Create a release with version and release notes
.\create_release.ps1 -Version "v1.2.3" -ReleaseNotes "Bug fixes and performance improvements"
```

### Option 2: Using Batch Script

The batch script also works but may have issues with quotes in PowerShell:

```bash
# Create a release with version v1.2.3
create_release.bat v1.2.3

# Create a release with version and release notes (use single quotes in PowerShell)
create_release.bat v1.2.3 'Bug fixes and performance improvements'
```

### Option 3: Manual Process

If you prefer to do it manually:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Changes
```bash
# Make your changes and test locally
python main.py

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature: profile management"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Create a Release Tag
```bash
# Create a new tag (use semantic versioning)
git tag v1.2.3

# Or create an annotated tag with release notes
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Bug fixes and performance improvements"

# Push the tag to trigger the release build
git push origin v1.2.3
```

#### Step 3: Monitor the Build
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions
2. Find the "Build and Release" workflow
3. Monitor the build progress
4. Check that the release was created successfully

## üìù Adding Release Notes

### Method 1: Using PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\create_release.ps1 -Version "v1.2.3" -ReleaseNotes "Bug fixes and performance improvements"
```

### Method 2: Using Batch Script
```bash
# In PowerShell, use single quotes
create_release.bat v1.2.3 'Bug fixes and performance improvements'

# In Command Prompt, use double quotes
create_release.bat v1.2.3 "Bug fixes and performance improvements"
```

### Method 3: Manual Annotated Tag
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Bug fixes and performance improvements"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### Method 4: Edit After Creation
1. Create the release using any method above
2. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Releases
3. Click "Edit" on the created release
4. Add detailed release notes in the description field
5. Save the changes

## üì¶ Release Assets

Each release will automatically include:
- `AppVolumeControl.exe` - The main executable
- Release notes (auto-generated from commits or from tag message)
- Source code (zip/tar.gz)

## üîß Manual Release (if needed)

If you need to create a release manually:

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí "Draft a new release"
2. Choose a tag or create a new one
3. Write release notes
4. Upload the `AppVolumeControl.exe` from your local `dist/` folder
5. Publish the release

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails - PyInstaller Not Found
**Error**: `'pyinstaller' is not recognized as an internal or external command`

**Solution**:
1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
3. Try building again:
   ```bash
   build.bat
   ```

### Build Fails - Other Issues
- Check the Actions logs for error details
- Verify all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Ensure `icon.ico` exists in the root directory
- Test the build locally with `build.bat`

### Release Not Created
- Verify the tag format starts with `v`
- Check that the tag was pushed to GitHub
- Ensure the workflow has proper permissions
- Check the Actions logs for errors

### Exe Not Included
- Verify the build step completed successfully
- Check that the file path in the workflow is correct
- Ensure the exe file was created in the `dist/` folder

### PowerShell Quote Issues
If you get quote-related errors in PowerShell:
1. Use the PowerShell script: `.\create_release.ps1`
2. Or use single quotes: `create_release.bat v1.2.3 'Bug fixes'`
3. Or run in Command Prompt instead of PowerShell

## üìù Best Practices

### Version Numbering
Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes

### Release Notes
- Write clear, user-friendly release notes
- Include new features and bug fixes
- Mention any breaking changes
- Add usage examples if needed

### Testing
- Always test locally before creating a release
- Verify the exe works on a clean system
- Test with different configurations
- Check that the icon displays correctly
